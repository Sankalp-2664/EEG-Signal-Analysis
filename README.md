# EEG-Signal-Analysis
This repo provides an EEG data processing pipeline for 109 subjects, each with 14 EDF files. It extracts raw signals, events, and timestamps using MNE, storing data efficiently in HDF5/.pkl. Supports event detection, preprocessing, and ML integration, with future updates for filtering and feature extraction.
